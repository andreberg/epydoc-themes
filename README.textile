h1. Epydoc CSS Stylesheet

This is a massivley hacked stylesheet for "epydoc":http://epydoc.sourceforge.net, the very nice Python API
Documentation generator. The general look and feel is based on "Sphinx":http://sphinx.pocoo.org.

Feel free to tweak this some more to make the theme even more pleasing 
if you have the time to spare for such things. The typography in particular
could do with sorting out. Unless you like writing masocistic CSS however,
I'd recommend looking to refactor the markup generated by epydoc.
